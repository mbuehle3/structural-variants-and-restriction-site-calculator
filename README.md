# Simple Calculator for Structural Variants and Restriction Sites Finder

This script was submitted for the Auburn University Computational Biology course. There are two sections of code in the bash file. 
The first counts and filters the number of respective structural variants (e.g. - insertions, deletions, inversions, and translocations).
It also calculates the average length, score and number or reads for each structural variant. 
Two tables are output from this section of the code, one with counts the other with scores. 

The second part of the script deals with finding restriction sites in a genomic fasta file.
Currently the script is hard coded for three specific restriction enzymes, but maybe someday I will fix that.
